If you know about commits, branches, remote, cloning, staging and committing, you should be fine. Let’s build upon that.</p><h2 id=section-1-git-storage-model>Section 1: Git Storage Model</h2><p>If you are familiar with the git’s object-based storage model, you can skip this section.</p><p>Git stores the <strong>entire snapshot</strong> of your project each time you commit. This is made possible by its <strong>object-based storage model</strong>. Here are some terms you should know.</p><ul><li><strong>Objects</strong>: Everything Git stores is an object. Each object is uniquely identified by a SHA-1 (or SHA-256) hash and stored in the <code>.git/objects</code> directory.</li><li><strong>Blob (Binary Large Object)</strong>: A blob stores the contents of a single file. It does not store the filename—just the file’s content.</li><li><strong>Tree</strong>: A tree represents a directory. It contains pointers to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories), along with names and metadata like file permissions.</li><li><strong>Commit</strong>: A commit points to a tree and contains metadata like the author, timestamp, message, and parent commit(s). It represents a snapshot of the project at a given point in time.</li></ul><p>When you commit a change, git does the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Blobs</strong> are created for the contents of each file in the project.</li><li>A <strong>tree</strong> object is created to map the directory structure and link to those blobs.</li><li>A <strong>commit</strong> object is created pointing to the tree, along with a reference to its parent commit (if any).</li><li>A <strong>ref</strong> (e.g., <code>main</code> or <code>HEAD</code>) is updated to point to the new commit hash.</li></ul><p>All these objects are saved in the <code>.git/objects/</code> directory, compressed using <code>zlib</code> and named after their hash values.</p><p>It is relatively easy to follow how git does so. Do the following</p><pre><code class=language-bash># Make a repo
mkdir your-repo
cd your-repo

# create some files
echo &quot;first file&quot; &gt;&gt; foo.txt
mkdir bar
echo &quot;second file&quot; &gt;&gt; bar/baz.txt

# add and commit
git add .
git status
git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;
</code></pre><p>Use <code>git log</code> to find the hash of current commit.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>commit 53b1b80d093d7ad66a3f612a56e0215ad9da5952 (HEAD -&gt; main)

</code></pre><p>Let’s observe our commit object inside the <code>.git/objects</code> directory using</p><pre><code class=language-bash>python -c &quot;import zlib,sys;print(zlib.decompress(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()).decode())&quot; .git/objects/53/b1b80d093d7ad66a3f612a56e0215ad9da5952
</code></pre><p>Make sure to insert a slash after the first two characters of the <code>SHA1</code> hash. It is how git stores them. We are using <code>zlib</code> to decompress the object file and read its contents because Git stores object using the <code>zlib</code> compression. The name of the commit (or the sha1 sum) is the sha1 sum of <strong>all</strong> the contents inside the commit object (including headers).</p><pre><code class=language-bash>commit 203tree 377295adbf4e9f01892fd377e467549b38adc16b

</code></pre><p>So, in summary, when you commit, a commit object is created which holds the sha1 sum of a tree object. The tree object’s contains the sha1 sum of files and directories present in the root directory of your project. By following these hashes, you will get to the sub-directories and all the files that was present at the time of the commit.</p><p>That is all you need to know about the git’s object based storage model.</p><hr><h2 id=section-2-git-clone>Section 2: Git Clone</h2><p>Git clone is done by making a request from a git client (installed on your system) to a git server (e.g. GitHub, Gitlab, or your own git server). Git uses either SSH or HTTP(S) to communicate with the server. You will find the protocol referred to as <strong>Smart HTTP(s)</strong> because there’s a special syntax to that.</p><p>Git clone takes place in two steps.</p><h3 id=ref-discovery>Ref Discovery</h3><p><img src=/images/articles/git-internals/git-clone-communication.png alt=git-clone-communication.png></p><ol><li>The client asks the server what <strong>refs</strong> are available.</li><li>The server sends a list of refs that are available and a <strong>list of capabilities.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Refs</strong> are just human-readable pointers to commits. Capabilities are features that the git server supports. For example, <code>side-band</code> means if you make the next request (about which I will talk about soon), the server will also send the progress alongside pack files. There are other features about which you can find more here: <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-capabilities>https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-capabilities</a>.</p><p>I have implemented my own git using <a href=https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview>Codecrafter&rsquo;s Build Your Own Git</a> challenge, which I will use to show the details the cloning process.

Right now, I am not requesting the server for any capabilities to show you the bare-minimum implementation of <code>git clone</code>.</p><p>The response to this request is a git pack file. Let me show you the structure of a packfile.</p><p><img src=/images/articles/git-internals/packfile-format.png alt=packfile-format.png></p><p>A packfile starts with a <code>pkt-line</code> encoded “NAK” literal. It is followed by a literal “PACK” literal.</p><h3 id=packfile-header>Packfile Header</h3><p>The next 4 bytes after that is designated for the version and the next 4 bytes after that correspond to the number of objects in the body that follows.</p><p>There is an important point to note here. The version and number of objects are stored in big-endian format. If you are familiar with big-endian and little-endian formats, you can skip this part. For the ones who aren’t, please continue reading.</p><p>Let us decode one to understand. Suppose, we encounter <code>00 00 00 02</code> while reading version and <code>00 00 01 4c</code> while reading the number of objects field.</p><p>In big endian format, the most significant byte comes first. So,</p><pre><code>Bytes (hex):      00    00    00    02
Position:         MSB               LSB
</code></pre><p>This means that the version is 2.</p><pre><code>Bytes (hex):      00    00    01    4c
Position:         MSB               LSB
</code></pre><p>This equates to 332 (0x0000014c) in decimal.</p><p>So, there are 332 unique objects that we will encounter next.</p><h3 id=packfile-body>Packfile Body</h3><p>Now, let us see how the contents of the packfile body is organized.</p><p><img src=/images/articles/git-internals/packfile-body.png alt=packfile-body.png></p><p>The illustration above shows that for each object, there will be a header section, and a zlib-compressed body section that will contain the object’s contents.</p><h3 id=object-header>Object Header</h3><p>The header section specifies two key things: object type, and the size of the object after decompression. The size is indicated so that the git client can allocate the memory for the decompressed object.</p><p>The object type may be any one of the following:</p><ul><li>COMMIT = 1 (001)</li><li>TREE = 2 (010)</li><li>BLOB = 3 (011)</li><li>TAG = 4 (100)</li><li>OFS_DELTA = 6 (110)</li><li>REF_DELTA = 7 (111)</li></ul><p>I will tell you what the numbers mean in a while.</p><p>Now, let us see how the object type and the object size can be extracted from the object header.</p><p>Read the first byte. The first byte’s bit[4-6] (index starts at 0) will tell you the type of the object. If you read the first byte into a variable <code>b</code>, you can find the size by doing following:</p><pre><code class=language-go>/* shift the byte to the right by 4 bits and AND with 0111, which will give you the object type  */
objTypeCode := (b &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0x7
</code></pre><p>The size is stored in a different way. Here is how you can extract it. From byte you just read (for extracting the type), just extract the 4 least significant bits.</p><pre><code class=language-go>/* extract the least significant 4 bits */
objectSize := int(b &amp; 0x0F)
</code></pre><p>Now, Check for MSB of <code>b</code>.</p><ol><li>If it is 0, you are done.</li><li>If not, read the next byte and extract the bits 0-6.</li><li>Now, shift the byte you just read by 4 bits (remember that the byte you read before this has 4 bits), and OR it with <code>objectSize</code> .</li><li>Check for MSB of the byte you just read, if it is 0, you are done.</li><li>If not, read next byte, and again extract the bits 0-6.</li><li>How much will you shift by this time? By 11 (7 + 4). By now, you must know what to do next.</li><li>You only stop if the MSB of the byte you just read is 0. If not, you extract the bits 0-6, shift it to the left by appropriate amount, and OR it with the size variable.</li></ol><pre><code>objectSize = ....... | ....... | ....... | ....
                             byte3     byte2    byte1   byte0
</code></pre><p>The first 4 bits come from the first byte’s bits 0-3. The next 7 bits come from <code>byte1 & 0x7F</code>, the next 7 bits from <code>byte2 & 0x7F</code> and so on.</p><p>Now, if the object is of type <code>REFDELTA</code>, additional 20 bytes are reserved for the SHA1 sum of the object it references. I will explain what a REFDELTA is in a while. But for now, you will need to keep in mind that you need to extract the SHA1 sum as well, if the object type is refdelta.</p><blockquote><p><em>I spent a few days trying to figure out why my zlib decompression was not working as I tried to decompress the content that was immediately available after objectSize for all types of objects, including REFDELTA</em></p></blockquote><h3 id=object-body>Object Body</h3><p>The object body is a zlib compressed chunk of data. You will need to decompress using zlib first.</p><p>Now, if you observe the decompressed objects, you will notice that for <code>blob</code>, <code>trees</code> and <code>commit</code>, the content is a bit different from what it appears in the object file inside <code>.git/objects</code> directory. To be exact, the body only contains everything after null termination character if the object were to be stored in a git object file.</p><p>For example, for a blob, the content will not be</p><pre><code>blob&lt;space&gt;&lt;size_after_null_terminator&gt;00&lt;content&gt;
</code></pre><p>but rather, only</p><pre><code>&lt;content&gt;
</code></pre><p>The same goes for tree and commit objects.</p><p>Now you can easily parse the contents of the object that appears in the packfile, except for the RefDeltas.</p><h3 id=refdelta>RefDelta</h3><p>If you know a little bit of calculus, you might know that delta means a small change. So, what is a refdelta? Refdelta is an object, which contains a set of instructions to create a new object from an existing one.</p><p><em>But why refdeltas? Why can’t git send me entire objects instead of refdeltas?</em></p><p>Refdeltas offer an efficient way to store objects. It tracks only the changes to be made to an object to create a new one. For example, you have a 1000 line file that you committed. In the next commit, you added 10 new lines. It is not efficient to send you two different blobs. The git server will send you the first object and a refdelta that tracks only that change made to that object. In this case, the additional 10 lines.</p><p>Remember the 20 bytes SHA1 in the header section that I told you to keep track of while parsing the object header? Yes, that is the sha1 hash of the object it references.</p><p>How do I create a new object from RefDelta? That, I will tell you shortly. First, let us understand how a RefDelta object is structured.</p><p><strong>How to extract the contents of RefDelta?</strong></p><p><img src=/images/articles/git-internals/refdelta.png alt=refdelta.png></p><p>The Refdelta contains source object size, followed by the target object size. The source object size is the size of the object it references. The target size is the final size of the object that will be created after the ref-delta has been applied to the object it references. The target size is followed by a series of COPY and/or ADD instructions. I will explain this shortly. Let us first understand how the size encoding is done in refdelta.</p><p><strong>How is source object size encoded?</strong></p><p>The same way object size is encoded in packfile header. The only difference is that you start by extracting the LSB 0-6 of the first byte instead of LSB 0-3, and shift the next byte by 7 instead of 4 in the first iteration. Everything is exactly the same. You stop when the MSB of the byte you just read is 0. This is called LEB128 encoding.</p><p>For example let’s say you read these bytes (in hex):</p><pre><code>0xE5 0x8E 0x26
</code></pre><p>Binary:</p><pre><code>0xE5 = 11100101 → continuation bit set (more to read), value bits: 1100101 = 0x65
0x8E = 10001110 → continuation bit set, value bits: 0001110 = 0x0E
0x26 = 00100110 → last byte, value bits: 0100110 = 0x26
</code></pre><p>Decoding:</p><pre><code>result = 0
result |= 0x65 &lt;&lt; 0
result |= 0x0E &lt;&lt; 7
result |= 0x26 &lt;&lt; 14

Total =  100197
</code></pre><p><strong>How is target object size encoded?</strong></p><p>The same way as the source size is.</p><p><strong>How are Instructions encoded?</strong></p><p>A refdelta object will have two type of instructions: <strong>COPY</strong> and <strong>ADD</strong>.</p><ol><li><strong>COPY:</strong> Copy data of size <code>n</code> from offset <code>offset</code> from the referenced file.</li><li><strong>ADD:</strong> Insert these literal data to object.</li></ol><p>After you’re done reading target object size, read next byte. If the MSB is 1, you are reading a COPY instruction. If it is 0, the instruction is ADD.</p><p><strong>ADD</strong></p><p>This one is very easy. Extract bits 0-6 from the byte you just read. It specifies the size of literal data in bytes. The literal data follows after this byte. You may have noticed that the maximum amount of data an ADD instruction can contain is 127 bytes (0x7F maximum). What if it git needs more than that? Git will simply insert a next ADD instruction after the first one if the size of literal data is greater than 127 bytes.</p><p><strong>COPY</strong></p><p>How do you extract data size (<code>n</code>) and the offset?</p><p>From the byte you just read,</p><ul><li><strong>Bits 6-4:</strong> Contains information on data size <code>n</code>.</li><li><strong>Bits 3-0:</strong> Contains information on offset.</li></ul><p>You must extract offset first, and then the size. Let me explain this using an example.</p><p>Let’s say the control byte <code>b</code> is:</p><pre><code>b = 11101101

Let's break this down

bit 0 = 1 → read next byte (for offset) → used as bits 0–7 of offset
bit 1 = 0 → skip                        → if this was read, it would have been bits 8-15 of offset
bit 2 = 1 → read next byte (for offset) → used as bits 16–23 of offset
bit 3 = 1 → read next byte (for offset) → used as bits 24–31 of offset

bit 4 = 0 → skip
bit 5 = 1 → read next byte (for size) → used as bits 8–15 of size
bit 6 = 1 → read next byte (for size) → used as bits 16–23 of size
</code></pre><p>First you extract offset by iterating over each bit in the LSB.</p><p>If the bit is 1, read next byte and left shift it by <code>8 * i</code> , where <code>i</code> is the position of current bit from the right, and OR it with offset. If it is 0, continue the loop.</p><p>Then you extract size by iterating over bits 4-6 of the control byte.</p><p>If it is 1, read next byte and left shift it by <code>(i - 4) * 8</code> , where <code>i</code> is the position of the current bit from the right, and OR it with size. If it is 0, continue the loop.</p><p>Now, you should be able to parse the contents of RefDelta object.</p><hr><h3 id=applying-refdelta>Applying RefDelta</h3><p>Even if you computed <code>sha1</code> of all of the object you decompressed, none of the refdeltas’ referenced SHA will match any of them.</p><p>After extracting the non-delta objects, you should prepend their content with an appropriate header. For example, if you extracted a blob object, prepend it with</p><pre><code>blob &lt;size&gt;00&lt;content
</code></pre><p>Just like it would appear in a git object file, and then only compute its SHA1. Now, you might notice that at least one object’s SHA1 should match the refdelta’s referenced SHA.</p><p>Let’s see how a refdelta object is applied to an existing one to create a new one.</p><p>Let’s say we have a <strong>base file</strong> (original Git object):</p><pre><code>Base file:
&quot;Hello, my name is Alice.\n&quot;
</code></pre><p>Given a refdelta object like this (The content on the right side of the arrow is the evaluation of that instruction)</p><pre><code>COPY offset=0, size=18 → &quot;Hello, my name is A&quot;

ADD 3 bytes: &quot;Bob&quot; → replace &quot;Alice&quot; with &quot;Bob&quot;

COPY offset=23, size=1 → copy the &quot;\n&quot;

ADD 21 bytes: &quot;Nice to meet you!\n&quot;
</code></pre><p>After applying this to the base file, the new file will be</p><pre><code>&quot;Hello, my name is ABob\nNice to meet you!\n&quot;
</code></pre><p><strong>How to apply all deltas?</strong></p><p>Store the delta objects in a queue. Keep dequeueing the queue until it is empty. On each dequeue, apply the refdelta to its referenced object. Generate a new object, and put it in your objects list.</p><p>After all deltas has been applied, initialize the <code>.git</code> directory, and save all the objects in <code>.git/objects</code> directory.</p><p><strong>Populating the cloned directory</strong></p><p>Keep track of the SHA1 of the HEAD. From there, find the sha1 of the head and it’s tree. Once you find the root tree, create every file and directory that appears in the tree object file, recursively. I am leaving this up to you. But this is how git does it.</p></main><footer><link rel=stylesheet href=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex/dist/katex.min.css><script src=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/katex/dist/katex.min.js,npm/katex/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js,npm/@xiee/utils/js/render-katex.js defer></script><script src=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xiee/utils/js/center-img.min.js defer></script><hr>© Udeshya Dhungana 2020 - Today | <a href=https://github.com/udeshyadhungana>Github</a> | <a href=https://x.com/udeshyadhungana>Twitter</a></footer></body></html>
