      <description>Hello. Today I want to write about Linear Regression. It is basically the &amp;#34;Hello, World&amp;#34; program of Machine Learning. It is used to model the relationship between one or more inputs and a single output. Its application ranges from engineering to business. It is a process of learning from data. It falls under supervised learning category of Maching Learning. Regarding the algorithm, we have a set of inputs ($X$) and their corresponding outputs ($Y$).</description>
