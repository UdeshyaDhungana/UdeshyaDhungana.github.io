      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have completed yet another 3-hour-long tutorial video on a new programming language and are well aware of basic concepts like variables, loops, functions, and arrays, but don’t know what to do next, well, this article is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with a wishful thinking. Don’t roll your eyes. Programming involves lots and lots of wishful thinkings. Assume that you’re an intern at a renowned company which specializes in numerical computation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linear Regression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello. Today I want to write about Linear Regression. It is basically&#xA;the &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; program of Machine Learning. It is used to model&#xA;the relationship between one or more inputs and a single output. Its application&#xA;ranges from engineering to business. It is a process of learning from data.&#xA;It falls under supervised learning category of Maching Learning.&#xA;Regarding the algorithm, we have a set of inputs&#xA;\(X\) and their corresponding outputs \(Y\). From this,we try to come&#xA;up with a linear equation that best fits the data. Then, we can use that&#xA;equation to predict the output for new inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The elegence of complex numbers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, today I want to write about a familiar topic in Higher&#xA;mathematics, complex numbers, and in particular, the Euler&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;formula. Complex Numbers show up in a number of different fields, like&#xA;signal processing, electromagetism, quantum mechanics and many&#xA;more. Though it&amp;rsquo;s a frequently occuring content, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;noticed, both the students and the experts are perplexed by complex&#xA;numbers. For example, the beginners become puzzled by basic questions&#xA;such as &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of \(\sqrt{-1}\) ?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Does \(\sqrt{-1}\)&#xA;even exist?&amp;rdquo;, and even some of the experts don&amp;rsquo;t understand the&#xA;intuition behind simple formula like Euler&amp;rsquo;s formula, and settle for&#xA;the explanation provided by hairy equations like Taylor&amp;rsquo;s expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Neovim for programming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, I have this never ending thirst for productivity. On&#xA;the journey of quinching this thirst, a few months ago, I stumbled&#xA;upon a fantastic&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6Q8Na575qc&#34;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube&#xA;about Vim. After that, I started to use Vim. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first&#xA;introduction to Vim though. I first came to know about it about an&#xA;year ago. Still, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to use it as my main editor,&#xA;because of one big problem: the learning curve. Vim is not easy to&#xA;learn, but once you get the hang of it, it starts to pay you off. It&#xA;took me about 20 days to become comfortable with it. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re&#xA;planning on using it, don&amp;rsquo;t be frustrated in the beginning. It&amp;rsquo;ll test&#xA;your patience, but you must stand your ground. I assume you are on a&#xA;Linux system. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
