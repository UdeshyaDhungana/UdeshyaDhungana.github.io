Today I want to write about Linear Regression. It is basically the &amp;#34;Hello, World&amp;#34; program of Machine Learning. It is used to model the relationship between one or more inputs and a single output. Its application ranges from engineering to business. It is a process of learning from data. It falls under supervised learning category of Maching Learning. Regarding the algorithm, we have a set of inputs ($X$) and their corresponding outputs ($Y$).</description></item><item><title>The elegence of complex numbers</title><link>https://udeshyadhungana.github.io/articles/2020-10-14-complex-numbers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://udeshyadhungana.github.io/articles/2020-10-14-complex-numbers/</guid><description>Hey folks, today I want to write about a familiar topic in Higher mathematics, complex numbers, and in particular, the Euler&amp;rsquo;s formula. Complex Numbers show up in a number of different fields, like signal processing, electromagetism, quantum mechanics and many more. Though it&amp;rsquo;s a frequently occuring content, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, both the students and the experts are perplexed by complex numbers. For example, the beginners become puzzled by basic questions such as &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of $\sqrt{-1}$ ?</description></item></channel></rss>
