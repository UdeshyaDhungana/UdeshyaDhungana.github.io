	It was early 2018 when teens all around the world started to use an app called Musically. It was a video sharing social media founded by Alex Zhu, a Chinese entrepreneur . Mainly used for making lip sync videos, the app's popularity skyrockted within months, if not, weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Suddenly, around the August of 2018, Musically was shut down overnight. But that wasn't the end of it. Users didn't lose their favorite app. They woke up to a surprise as they found their favorite app replaced with a new logo and name: Tiktok. It had been acquired by a Chinese company Bytedance much earlier, and it was then, when they had officially changed the name and logo. It was nothing different for user. Existing Musically accounts were automatically migrated to Tiktok, with a slight change in UI. But the core feature was same: short videos upto 15 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The app's popularity was still uprising. It only took it a  few months after that to become no. 1 social media app on Google Play Store and iOS App Store. Users didn't seem to care who was behind the app, or the privacy issues regarding it. As of the date this article is written, Tiktok has 1B+ downloads on Play Store alone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tiktok: Exposed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The app has received criticisms from its privacy and security. It has been rumored that it is a spyware backed by the CCP. But, let's not get political and believe in rumors. Searching for facts, I stumbled upon a reddit comment. It was by a person, who does reverse engineering of apps. I am going to present a short summary of his comment here and provide the link on footer.

	After reverse engineering the app, it has been found that it collect following data:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Phone hardware (cpy type, hardware IDs, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Everything related to network (IP, local IP, router MAC, wifi access point name )&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Whether or not your phone is rooted/jailbroken&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If location is enabled, it does GPS pinging every 30 seconds. In layman's terms, it keeps track of your location.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Every photos in your gallery. &lt;span class=&quot;font-italic&quot;&gt;Started to feel a little insecure?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Information on other apps you have installed. This includes your Facebook, Instagram, shopping websites, and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The company has different protections in place to prevent anyone from reverse engineering and debugging the app. The app changes its default behavior if it knows it is being monitored. And the app has few snippets of code, which allows it to download a remote zip file, extract it, and execute the binary. Not a single app needs this feature, unless it's a spyware. Do you think that's it? Nope!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The app haven't been using HTTPS until recently. The company has leaked users' email addresses, as well as their secondary email, which is used for password recovery. The security was so weak, that even a beginner hacker could get access to every single one of the app's users and their personal details with easily. Remember a minute ago, when I said the app is rumored to be backed my CCP. Well, here's a &lt;span class=&quot;font-italic&quot;&gt;not so concrete&lt;/span&gt; proof. Upload a video of Tiananmen Square protest and see how it gets taken down faster than you blink.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problems beyond screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The app entices its new users by providing them with a sense of 'virality'. It means that one's very first video is likely to get more views and likes, regardless of its quality, keeping the user hooked to the platform, craving for more views and likes. Oh, almost forgot this one! There are a bunch of creepy old men trying to access the children on the app. It's been found that 40-50 year old men getting 8-10 year old to do 'duets' with them in sexually suggestive songs. And yes, Tiktok even has direct messaging functionality. I don't want to trigger anyone but, feminists, I think it's a problem when 9-10 year olds are twerking to gain views on internet. I'm mentioning this because it's very common on Tiktok.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, Tiktok &lt;span class=&quot;font-weight-bold&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a spyware. It may be a video sharing website on front, but it's much darker than that internally. It does everything from exposing your personal information to collecting data about you. I think it's time we, as a conscious consumer, and as a person, realize that this app is a big problem. It's time we abandon this platform. It's time we provide local app developers a chance to create a Tiktok like app, which, lets you enjoy the platform without having privacy and security issues, while caring for user's need.
&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
