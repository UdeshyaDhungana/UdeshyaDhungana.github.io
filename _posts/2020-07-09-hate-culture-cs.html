<p>Hey folks! In between the frenzy of programming and typhoon of online courses, today I decided to cast light upon a dark side of the programming community. It's not that hate this field, I hate the existence of hate culture in this field. Yet, it's prevalent widely.</p>

<p>As a student of Computer Engineering and a programmer, I encountered many hurdles reaching here. I'll try to explain some of them in brief. As of this writing, I am in fourth semester of my degree.</p>

<h4>Some fields are better than others</h4>
<p>I precisely don't remember when I began hating web development. It was around the start of second semester when I was at my prime of hating this field. I remember saying things like "I'd never be a web developer" or, "It is not that cool." Now that I'm passionately studying web development, have done many projects in this field, and have seen people I know making a living out of this, I cannot appreciate this field enough. I realize how wrong I was back then, and how I was a victim of this hate culture; how these<i> influential </i>YouTubers and Medium articles led me into believing that this was not a good career choice.</p> 

<h4>Real programmers code on Machine level</h4>
<p>Every once in a while, I encounter a post on my Facebook or Reddit feed that "real" programmers use low level languages like C, C++ ,or something like that. I silently hope, these people who are writing these posts are doing it as a sarcasm. Because, there is no such thing as a perfect language. Programming languages are like swiss knives. Yes, any single language can do everything (atleast if they're Turing complete). But, it's definitely not a good choice to use MATLAB for Raspberry Pi or Assembly code for web development. <b>#AllLanguagesMatter</b></p>

<h4>Linux users are superior, bonus if you use Arch</h4>
<p>If you have a glance at<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace"> r/linuxmasterrace, </a>you'll be greeted with how dumb you are if you happen to use Windows. This behavior is not seen only on Reddit, every human you meet who happens to use Linux will not spare a chance to humiliate for using Windows, and sing the glory of Linux Master Race. While, it's true that Linux has numerous advantages over Windows, they're difficult for your average Joe. Not everyone will be willing to spend hours and hours to set up operating system, and learn about it's internals. </p>
